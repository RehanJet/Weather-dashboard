# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Description

I wanted to make a 5 day forecast weather dashboard so that I could input a city to view the current weather as and able to plan my events accordingly. The data that I was wanting to included in the display incudes the date, an icon representing the weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and the wind speed. I was also wanting to add my previously searched cities to a list that I could click on and find the weather again. While putting this weather dashboard together i learned more about how to use API calls.
